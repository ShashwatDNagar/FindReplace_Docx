# Find and Replace for Docx documents

Two scripts (in *Python* and *Perl*, choose either) that find and replace all instances
of a word in a Docx document.

The two scripts use system commands to unzip, modify, and re-zip the Docx file with the desired substitutions.

Currently, the scripts only support words (not phrases - spaces in the find and replace will yield unexpected results). Functionality that deals with this will be added soon.
